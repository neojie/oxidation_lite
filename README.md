under `burnman/eos/` ï¼Œ replace the following files with the ones in `burnman_patches/eos`

```bash
burnman/eos/helper.py

burnman/eos/modified_vinet.py

burnman/eos/__init__.py

burnman/eos/mie_grueneisen_debye.py
```



under `burnman/minerals`, replace (or add if not existed already) these files with the ones in `burnman_patches/minerals`

```bash
burnman/minerals/other.py

burnman/minerals/LF_2012.py
```



Note I made modifications on burnman 0.9.0. There may be some official updates on the scripts mentioned above. In order to play safe, you may want to manually add my added lines in the these scripts. You can use `diff` command to find the difference between my modified scripts and official scripts.
